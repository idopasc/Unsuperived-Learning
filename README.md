# unsuperived-learning-ML

This notebook delves into unsupervised learning methods, focusing on K-means clustering and data visualization through PCA.

It begins by loading local files and importing datasets from Kaggle. Using Scikit-learn, K-means clustering is applied, and PCA is performed for dimensionality reduction. Various visualizations illustrate the results.

To assess clustering performance, the Elbow method, Silhouette analysis, and accuracy metrics are used. The notebook features the 'Fake and real news' and 'Fashion MNIST' datasets from Kaggle and is implemented in Python.
