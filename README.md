# Unsupervised Learning for Text Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction

In this notebook, I will perform unsupervised learning to cluster text data (fake news) and visualize the results using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The workflow includes loading data, preprocessing it, applying clustering algorithms, visualizing the results, and evaluating the clustering performance.

Key Steps and Tasks:

1. **Loading Data**:
Load local files and Kaggle datasets.

2. **Data Preparation**

3. **Clustering**

4. **Dimensionality Reduction and Visualization**

5. **Performance Evaluation:**
 - Evaluate the clustering performance using confusion matrices and accuracy metrics.
 - Compare the cluster labels with the true labels to determine the accuracy. 
 - Perform silhouette analysis and elbow method to find the optimal number of clusters.

6. **Comparing Clustering Approaches:**
 - Compare the effectiveness of clustering with and without prior dimensionality reduction.
 - Observe that PCA does not significantly change the clustering results as it maintains the relative distances between points.

7. **Extending to MNIST Dataset:**
 - Apply the same clustering and evaluation methods to the MNIST dataset.
